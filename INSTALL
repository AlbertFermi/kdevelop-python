To install, do this:
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make parser
make install

IMPORTANT: If you're using Arch Linux: Arch breaks the standard of having "python" point to a python2 implementation. This breaks stuff.
So if you're using arch, either make "python" call some python2 interpreter instead of python3 while compiling (only while compiling, doesn't matter afterwards)
or edit the file python-src/Parser/asdl_c.py and change the first line to point to your python2 implementation, so usually replace
#! /usr/bin/env python
with
#! /usr/bin/env python2
