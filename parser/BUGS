This are known bugs of the parser that should be fixed but are not easy to fix or reproduce:

- unexpected EOF error when parsing automatix.py which shouldn't have a newline at the end of the file for this (or test_runner.py)
	Or use 
"def a():
	i=1
	j=i"

- crash sometimes (hard to reproduce) when a file has no newline before EOF
