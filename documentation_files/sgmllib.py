class SGMLParser:


	"""
	The :class:`SGMLParser` class is instantiated without arguments. The parser is
	hardcoded to recognize the following constructs:
	
	* Opening and closing tags of the form ``<tag attr="value" *more>`` and
	``</tag>``, respectively.
	
	* Numeric character references of the form ``&#name;``.
	
	* Entity references of the form ``&name;``.
	
	* SGML comments of the form ``<!--text-->``.  Note that spaces, tabs, and
	newlines are allowed between the trailing ``>`` and the immediately preceding
	``--``.
	
	A single exception is defined as well:
