class UserList:


	"""
	Class that simulates a list.  The instance's contents are kept in a regular
	list, which is accessible via the :attr:`data` attribute of :class:`UserList`
	instances.  The instance's contents are initially set to a copy of *list*,
	defaulting to the empty list ``[]``.  *list* can be any iterable, e.g. a
	real Python list or a :class:`UserList` object.
