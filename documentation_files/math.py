""":synopsis: Mathematical functions (sin() etc.).


This module is always available.  It provides access to the mathematical
functions defined by the C standard.

These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the
same name from the :mod:`cmath` module if you require support for complex
numbers.  The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and
those which don't is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much
mathematics as required to understand complex numbers.  Receiving an exception
instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex
number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it
was generated in the first place.

The following functions are provided by this module.  Except when explicitly
noted otherwise, all return values are floats.

def ceil(x):
	"""
	Return the ceiling of *x* as a float, the smallest integer value greater than or
	equal to *x*.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def copysign(x,y):
	"""
	Return *x* with the sign of *y*.  On a platform that supports
	signed zeros, ``copysign(1.0, -0.0)`` returns *-1.0*.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def fabs(x):
	"""
	Return the absolute value of *x*.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def factorial(x):
	"""
	Return *x* factorial.  Raises :exc:`ValueError` if *x* is not integral or
	is negative.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def floor(x):
	"""
	Return the floor of *x* as a float, the largest integer value less than or equal
	to *x*.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def fmod(x,y):
	"""
	Return ``fmod(x, y)``, as defined by the platform C library. Note that the
	Python expression ``x % y`` may not return the same result.  The intent of the C
	standard is that ``fmod(x, y)`` be exactly (mathematically; to infinite
	precision) equal to ``x - n*y`` for some integer *n* such that the result has
	the same sign as *x* and magnitude less than ``abs(y)``.  Python's ``x % y``
	returns a result with the sign of *y* instead, and may not be exactly computable
	for float arguments. For example, ``fmod(-1e-100, 1e100)`` is ``-1e-100``, but
	the result of Python's ``-1e-100 % 1e100`` is ``1e100-1e-100``, which cannot be
	represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising ``1e100``.  For
	this reason, function :func:`fmod` is generally preferred when working with
	floats, while Python's ``x % y`` is preferred when working with integers.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def frexp(x):
	"""
	Return the mantissa and exponent of *x* as the pair ``(m, e)``.  *m* is a float
	and *e* is an integer such that ``x == m * 2**e`` exactly. If *x* is zero,
	returns ``(0.0, 0)``, otherwise ``0.5 <= abs(m) < 1``.  This is used to "pick
	apart" the internal representation of a float in a portable way.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def fsum(iterable):
	"""
	Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.  Avoids
	loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums::
	
	>>> sum([.1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1])
	0.9999999999999999
	>>> fsum([.1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1])
	1.0
	
	The algorithm's accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the
	typical case where the rounding mode is half-even.  On some non-Windows
	builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may
	occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its
	least significant bit.
	
	For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the `ASPN cookbook
	recipes for accurate floating point summation
	<http://code.activestate.com/recipes/393090/>`_\.

def isinf(x):
	"""
	Check if the float *x* is positive or negative infinity.
	
	"""

def isnan(x):

	Check if the float *x* is a NaN (not a number).  For more information
	on NaNs, see the IEEE 754 standards.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def ldexp(x,i):
	"""
	Return ``x * (2**i)``.  This is essentially the inverse of function
	:func:`frexp`.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def modf(x):
	"""
	Return the fractional and integer parts of *x*.  Both results carry the sign
	of *x* and are floats.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def trunc(x):
	"""
	Return the :class:`Real` value *x* truncated to an :class:`Integral` (usually
	a long integer).  Uses the ``__trunc__`` method.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def exp(x):
	"""
	Return ``e**x``.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def expm1(x):
	"""
	Return ``e**x - 1``.  For small floats *x*, the subtraction in
	``exp(x) - 1`` can result in a significant loss of precision; the
	:func:`expm1` function provides a way to compute this quantity to
	full precision::
	
	>>> from math import exp, expm1
	>>> exp(1e-5) - 1  # gives result accurate to 11 places
	1.0000050000069649e-05
	>>> expm1(1e-5)    # result accurate to full precision

def log(x,base):

	With one argument, return the natural logarithm of *x* (to base *e*).
	
	With two arguments, return the logarithm of *x* to the given *base*,
	calculated as ``log(x)/log(base)``.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def log1p(x):
	"""
	Return the natural logarithm of *1+x* (base *e*). The
	result is calculated in a way which is accurate for *x* near zero.
	
	"""
	pass
	
def log10(x):
	"""
	Return the base-10 logarithm of *x*.  This is usually more accurate
	than ``log(x, 10)``.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def pow(x,y):
	"""
	Return ``x`` raised to the power ``y``.  Exceptional cases follow
	Annex 'F' of the C99 standard as far as possible.  In particular,
	``pow(1.0, x)`` and ``pow(x, 0.0)`` always return ``1.0``, even
	when ``x`` is a zero or a NaN.  If both ``x`` and ``y`` are finite,
	``x`` is negative, and ``y`` is not an integer then ``pow(x, y)``
	is undefined, and raises :exc:`ValueError`.

	Return the square root of *x*.

	Return the arc tangent of *x*, in radians.
	
	
	"""
	pass
	
def atan2(y,x):
	"""
	Return ``atan(y / x)``, in radians. The result is between ``-pi`` and ``pi``.
	The vector in the plane from the origin to point ``(x, y)`` makes this angle
	with the positive X axis. The point of :func:`atan2` is that the signs of both
	inputs are known to it, so it can compute the correct quadrant for the angle.
	For example, ``atan(1)`` and ``atan2(1, 1)`` are both ``pi/4``, but ``atan2(-1,
	-1)`` is ``-3*pi/4``.
