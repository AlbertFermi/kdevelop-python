One can create a pool of processes which will carry out tasks submitted to it
with the :class:`Pool` class.

	A process pool object which controls a pool of worker processes to which jobs
	can be submitted.  It supports asynchronous results with timeouts and
	callbacks and has a parallel map implementation.
	
	*processes* is the number of worker processes to use.  If *processes* is
	``None`` then the number returned by :func:`cpu_count` is used.  If
	*initializer* is not ``None`` then each worker process will call
	``initializer(*initargs)`` when it starts.
