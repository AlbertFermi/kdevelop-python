- Support "from ... import *"
- fix function argument calltip (currently implemented incorrectly)
- write debugger interface
- use PYTHONPATH for searching includes
- add C module template
- add a lot of error reporting
- support unsure types in autocompletion / highlighting


A note from David Nolden(one of the authors of C++ Language support):
[2007-09-04 23:38] <dnolden> apaku: Btw. I have thought a bit about python code-completion. I think to make it really good, you need the following:
[2007-09-04 23:38] <dnolden> 1. An expression-parser, that is able to determine the type of any python expression (maybe could be integrated in type-builder)
[2007-09-04 23:39] <dnolden> 2. A specialized PythonDeclaration class that can hold an arbitrarily sized list of types
[2007-09-04 23:39] <dnolden> 3. Whenever assigning something to a value, evaluate that somethings type, and add it to the declarations type-list
[2007-09-04 23:40] <dnolden> However expression-parsing was a lot of work for c++, I don't know how much it would be for python
